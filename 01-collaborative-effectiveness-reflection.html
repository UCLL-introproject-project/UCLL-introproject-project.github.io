<p>The power of effective communication can hardly be underestimated. Collaboration is a crucial skill in both academic and professional settings. It involves working effectively with others to achieve a common goal. For this assignment, you will reflect on a collaborative project you recently completed with a partner. The goal is to assess your ability to work together efficiently and reflect on the lessons learned from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="3-challenge">3. Challenge</h2>
<p>Give us sufficient proof that you worked together on your pygame development project with someone from your network. This can be an e-mail conversation, a video recording of you cooperating with someone, etc. If you donâ€™t know anyone from your network who can help you with this, look online (e.g. on specialised forums) for peers. Describe who you worked together with and how you work together (how often, online or in person, synchronous or asynchronous etc.). Also reflect on how the cooperation went. Did you always get the response or result you wanted or expected? What could you have done better? What have you learned in terms of professional communication for the future?</p>
