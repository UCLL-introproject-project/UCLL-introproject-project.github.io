    <h1>Introductieproject - Pygame Development Project</h1>

    <h2>Assignment Description</h2>

    <p>As part of "Introductieproject," you’ll use Python game development as an opportunity to practice key learning outcomes such as researching IT solutions, taking initiative, and seeking outside help where and how appropriate. In this project, you will build your own computer game inspired by the classic card game, Blackjack, utilizing the Pygame library. The focus of this assignment lies in the process of problem-solving, resourcefulness, and the application of your programming skills.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>Your primary task is to follow a comprehensive tutorial available on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3YkdOXhFpQ">How to Program a Blackjack Card Game With Python!</a>. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a functional Blackjack game using Python and Pygame. Here we will emphasize the process of understanding and overcoming challenges over the final product.</p>

    <p>In addition to your primary task, there are three associated challenges for you to complete.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="01-collaborative-effectiveness-reflection.html">Collaborative Effectiveness Reflection</a></li>
            <li><a href="02-professional-communication.html">Professional Communication</a></li>
            <li><a href="03-stack-overflow.html">Stack Overflow</a></li>
        </ul>
    <p>These tasks will require you to collaborate with someone on the project, send an email asking for help with the project, and evaluate the popular IT knowledge sharing platform. Therefore, it's advisable to review the challenges before beginning the project, so you're ready to include them as you work on it. </p>
    
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

    <p>The essence of this project lies in the journey of learning and problem-solving, and we don’t expect you to already be an expert programmer. If you’ve been following Programming 1 already, you already have a basic understanding of Python programming. If you haven’t followed P1 or you find yourself needing additional support, you can refer to the following introductory Python tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8pPdKYpowI">Python Tutorial for Beginners</a>. This video will help you grasp the fundamentals of Python and provide a solid foundation for the game development project.</p>

    <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Problem-Solving and Resourcefulness: Develop the ability to independently troubleshoot issues, seek outside resources for help, and apply problem-solving skills to overcome challenges encountered during the development process.</li>
        <li>Iterative Development: Embrace an iterative approach to game development, where continuous improvement and learning from mistakes are valued over achieving a perfect end product.</li>
        <li>Documentation and Communication: Practice effective documentation of your code, explaining the reasoning behind your decisions. Prepare to defend your project during an oral exam by clearly communicating your thought process.</li>
        <li>Presentation Skills: Demonstrate your understanding of the project by presenting a live demo and answering questions during the oral exam.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Functionality: Successful implementation of key features from the tutorial, with an emphasis on understanding and adapting the code rather than blindly following steps.</li>
        <li>Creativity: Showcase your unique ideas and creative enhancements to the Blackjack game, demonstrating a personal touch to your project. You should be able to show that you have made your own changes or additions to the original project. This could be things like adding images or sounds, creating extra players, storing and displaying a list of high scores, etc.</li>
        <li>Documentation and Communication: Clearly document your code, explaining your thought process and decision-making. During the oral exam, effectively present and defend your project.</li>
        <li>Process over Product: Emphasize the learning process, problem-solving, and resourcefulness over the perfection of the final product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Project Submission: You’ll use Github Classroom for this project, as it is a primary tool for collaborative programming in education and industry. You’ll start with an empty repository and add to it as you work, using Git commands. If you have no experience with Git, you should work through the Git challenges before beginning this project.
            <ul>
                <li>Accept the Assignment here: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/z52WEKZz">https://classroom.github.com/a/z52WEKZz</a></li>
                <li>Navigate to a folder on your computer where you would like to store the files for your project. This can be in the same location as your challenges repository, but it should NOT be inside another repo. For example, a folder on your computer called UCLL, with a folder inside called Introductieproject and then 2 separate folders inside that: one for the challenges and one for this project.</li>
                <li>Run the command inside the introductieproject folder to create a new folder for this project:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>git clone https://github.com/UCLL-introproject-project/pygame-development-project-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Deadline: Your project should be submitted at least 10 days before your exam moment. You can submit by pushing everything to your personal repository and adding or editing the README file to indicate it is complete.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Resources</h2>

    <p>Throughout the project, feel free to explore additional resources, online documentation, or forums to expand your knowledge and troubleshoot any challenges you may encounter. Remember, the goal is not just to build a game but to develop your problem-solving skills and learn from the journey. Enjoy the process of exploration and creativity in Python game development. <br> 
        If you find yourself stuck on the project and would like to book an appointment for help, please contact Mr. Destexhe at <a href="mailto:tim.destexhe@ucll.be">tim.destexhe@ucll.be</a><br><br>Good luck!</p>
